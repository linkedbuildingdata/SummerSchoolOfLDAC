    "# Generation of 3D Virtual Reality Scene from Linked Building Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Lecturer: **Walter Terkaj**, \n",
    "[RG](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Walter_Terkaj)\n",
    "\n",
    "This coding challenge is proposed by the Erasmus+ project Virtual Factory \n",
    "Learning Toolkit [VLFT](https://www.vlft.eu/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual Reality (VR) is more and more spreading as a technology for immersive visualization of 3D scenes, including civil and industrial buildings. Such technology can be exploited to support the design, planning, management and control of the building environment while providing a realistic feeling. VR environments can be used to identify possible problems before they happen in the real world, for training and learning purposes, to enhance collaboration, and to improve safety. \n",
    "\n",
    "VR is mainly an advanced visual interface and it is not particularly useful as standalone application. Therefore, there is a clear need to integrate with other tools and methodologies; this can be achieved thanks to a linked data approach [1]. [Req.1]\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it must be noted that the generation of VR scenes may require specific expertise and a long lead time, while returing as result a solution that can be highly customized but difficult to be updated (cf. solutions developed in [Unity](https://unity.com/) or [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com)). Therefore, there is a need of simplified and automated workflows for the dynamic and reconfigurable generation of VR scenes [Req.2] without asking for complex hardware and software setup [Req.3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the expected outcome is a routine developed in any programming language for the rapid creation of a 3D virtual environment that is free and portable. The routine will be easily reconfigured to take into account the location and spatial relationships of the building assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the coding challenge you will work on the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set-up the building ontology model as LBD ABox triples. This can be created from scratch or existing models can be reused. Possible reference Tbox are [ifcOWL](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifcOWL/IFC4_ADD2), Linked Building Data (LBD) ontologies ([BOT](https://w3id.org/bot#), [PRODUCT](https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/product), \n",
    "[PROPS](https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/props), [OPM](https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/opm)), etc. [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prepare 3D models for VR environment. It is suggested to use [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/)(GL Transmission Format) that is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Link building information with 3D VR models. Please refer to the coding challenge [Extraction and Semantic Annotation of Geometry Data from IFC](02-03-Geometry-Coding-Challenge.ipynb) for more details about possible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extract LBD via SPARQL query and dynamically generate a reconfigurable VR scene for web-based applications. It is suggested to employ WebGL-based solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* RQ1: How to enhance a building ontology model by linking 3D models as \n",
    "external files (gLTF format) in preparation of VR applications?\n",
    "* RQ2: How to automatically generate a reconfigurable VR scene in a free and portable format?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* Several building models are available on the web, e.g. [Duplex Apartment House as \n",
    "IFC](https://portal.nibs.org/files/wl/?id=4DsTgHFQAcOXzFetxbpRCECPbbfUqpgo), [OSH Flat as \n",
    "IFC](https://github.com/TechnicalBuildingSystems/OpenSmartHomeData/blob/master/04_Flat.ifc), [Open IFC model server](http://openifcmodel.cs.auckland.ac.nz/Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Already available gLTF models in KhronosGroup database of [gLTF 2.0 samples](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A [working example of VR scene](./data/babylonJS/BabylonJS_VR_gLTF.html) based on [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) that can be loaded by a generic browser (e.g. Firefox, Internet Explore) as an .html file. The content of .html file is based on JavaScript and can be reconfigured to load any scene consisting of gLTF models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* [IFCtoLBD](https://github.com/jyrkioraskari/IFCtoLBD) converter, [IFCtoRDF](https://github.com/pipauwel/IFCtoRDF) converter, the \n",
    "[Jena library](https://jena.apache.org/) for creating the RDF triples. \n",
    "\n",
    "* gLTF tools are listed [here](), e.g. converters, importers, and exporters, applications ([Blender 2.80](https://www.blender.org/), [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cesium.gltf-vscode) of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).\n",
    "Tutorial about the creation of VR 3D models can be found online, e.g. [3],[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "* Several 3D web-based applications/libraries are available, e.g. [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), [three.js](https://threejs.org/)\n",
