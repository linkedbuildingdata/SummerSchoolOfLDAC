    "\n",
    "This notebook tutorial aims to provide the reader with a step-by-step tutorial for converting ifcOWL IfcStandardWallCase geometries into GeoSPARQL and export them as ifcOWL with added GeoSPARQL and also BOT with GeoSPARQL. You will also learn how to write and execute some simple GeoSPARQL queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "*  Show how to use the Jena code base for adding GeoSPARQL to a sample ifcOWL and BOT model;  \n",
    "* Demonstrate some simple geospatial queries over the resulting data."
