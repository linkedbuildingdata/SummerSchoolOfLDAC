    "## STEP 3 SETTING UP THE TRIPLESTORE AND SPARQL \n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up a triplestore and SPARQL endpoint is straightforward. Several suites exist which support GeoSPARQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Stardog](http://stardog.com/) (free for non-commercial purposes)  \n",
    "* [Parliament](http://parliament.semwebcentral.org/)  \n",

    "* …  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we are going to use Stardog. GeoSPARQL is only supported with the commercial license, so if your license has run out, Parliament is a good free option (and very easy to setup!). \n",
    "\n",
    "After you download stardog, extract it into a folder on your hard drive, following the instructions [here](https://www.stardog.com/docs/#_quick_start_guide)\n",
    "\n",
    "For windows the following instructions are given:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, tell Stardog where its home directory (where databases and other files will be stored) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> SET STARDOG_HOME=C:\\data\\stardog\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, copy the stardog-license-key.bin into the right place:\n",
    "\n",
    "> COPY /B stardog-license-key.bin %STARDOG_HOME%\n",
    "\n",
    "Stardog won’t run without a valid Stardog-license-key.bin in STARDOG_HOME. You should have received one when you downloaded Stardog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, optionally, place the bin folder of the Stardog install on your PATH so the stardog.bat and stardog-admin.bat scripts can be used regardless of current working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "> SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\\stardog-6.2.1\\bin\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also make sure you have a JDK installed. For Stardog 6.2.1 I used the latest jdk downloaded from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start your server there are still a few more hoops to jump through. First you will need to create a stardog.properties file and save it into folder data/stardog. You can find the properties file [here](https://github.com/stardog-union/stardog-examples/blob/develop/config/stardog.properties)\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to them comment out the line “spatial.use.jts=true” (remove the #).\n",
