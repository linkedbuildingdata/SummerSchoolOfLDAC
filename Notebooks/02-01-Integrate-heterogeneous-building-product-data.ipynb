    "# Semantic Integration of Heterogeneous Building Product Data\n",
    "Lecturer: **Anna Wagner**, [RG](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Wagner13)   \n",
    "Co-Lecturer: **Georg Ferdinand Schneider**, [RG](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Georg_Schneider3)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The exchange of product data related to products in the buildings domain is a cumbersome task as it involves multiple companies, domains and dataformats. Linked Data and Semantic Web Technologies (LD & SWT) have been identified to be beneficial, when addressing this heterogeneity in building product data [1,2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributing semantically annotated product data on the web using LD & SWT is nowadays an industry standard [3]. In particular, the [schema.org](https://schema.org/) and [GoodRelations](http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/) schemas are to be mentioned as they are supported by main search engines, such as Google, Bing, Baidu, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential of LD & SWT in building product data have not yet been fully exploited. Examples for its application exists [2,4,[BauDataWeb](http://semantic.eurobau.com/)], however some problems remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A plethora of schemas exits but have not been mapped to a top level product data ontology, e.g., GoodRelations;  \n",
    "* Mappings of building product data schemas to other well established domain models such as the Industry Foundations Classes (IFC) do not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this coding challenge you will work on the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bootstrap a novel schema (Tbox) for a real product data standard, the German VDI3805 [5-8];  \n",
    "* Acquire real product data from the CSV file based real product data catalogue and populate your schema level ontology;  \n",
    "* Link your schema to other (building) product data ontologies such as [BauDataWeb](http://semantic.eurobau.com/), [GoodRelations](http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html), [BPO](https://w3id.org/bpo), [bsDD-LD](https://github.com/PeterWillems/BIMbots-PSD-Repository) ... to experience cross-domain integration  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* RQ1: Which schema level alignments exist among building product data and other ontologies in the buildings domain?  \n",
    "* RQ2: Can a national standard, such as VDI 3805, be easily mapped to existing standards for product data on the web?  \n",
    "* RQ3: Which best practices exists, or can be defined, for publishing building product data on the web via LD & SWT?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "A large number of manufacturer catalogues compliant to VDI 3805 exist and are distributed via web portals [vdi3805-bim.de](http://vdi3805-bim.de) or [vdi3805.org](http://www.vdi3805.org/index.php).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A set of ontologies used for building product data exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [GoodRelations](http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html)  \n",
    "* [FreeClassOWL](http://www.freeclass.eu/freeclass_v1.html)  \n",
    "* [BauDataWeb](http://semantic.eurobau.com/)  \n",
    "* [Building Product Ontology (BPO)](https://w3id.org/bpo)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Karma Data Integration tool](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/karma/)  \n",
    "* [RDFlib - a pyhton module for rdf parsing and serialisation](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/)  \n",
